# Computer Networks Project 1 - *FTP Server And Client*

## Project Description
This is a simplified **FTP** written in C for the transfer of file between two hosts using TCP. Since this is a simplified version of the protocol we implemented only 
   - [X] USER and PASS: Login functionality
   - [X] LIST : List the files in the current working directly
   - [X] STOR : Send a file from client to server
   - [X] RETR : Request and receive a file from the server
   - [X] PWD  : Get the working directory 
   - [X] CWD  : Change the working directory 
   - [X] QUIT : Quit the program

## TEST CASES
Below is an image of the working program. 


## Test code
- Find test code in the directory. To be able to get it to work, you will need to change the names of the example files and the paths.
- Also, you need to run the execute file in privileged mode.
